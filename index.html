		<p lang="en" style="tet-align:center;">Cats are great pets.  They are low-maintenance, affectionate, clean, and longtime companions of humans, since before the times of Ancient Egyptians, even. <br> Tigger is a 13lb, long-haired, orange cat.  He has been in my family since I was 11, and he has lived with me in Athens since January of 2017.  He is very friendly and gets along well with other cats and dogs.  My favorite thing to do with him is curl up on the bed with a book and snuggle.  Tigger can sometimes be irritating when he meows very loudly at night when I am sleeping or begs for food all the time.  He hates going anywhere in the car, but especially to the vet.  Sometimes he has accidents in the house.  However, he has been tremendously helpful and improved my life significantly, especially in the area of mental health.</p>

		<p lang="en" style="text-align:center;">As you can see from above, Tigger receives an insulin shot twice a day.  That is because he has diabetes--didn't know cat's could get that, did you?  He was diagnosed in January, which was disheartening because, even with proper care, it will probably shorten his lifespan, and it has already greatly reduced his muscle mass.  Tigger also has high blood pressure and a heart murmur.  It is a lot fo work to keep him healthy.  The insulin is expensive, and being home to administer the doses about every 12 hours is hard to plan my schedule around.  Over Thanksgiving break, Tigger went into a diabetic coma and nearly died.  It was an exhausting--and I say traumatizing--night during which I stayed up for hours waiting for him to die, and then woke up in the morning after falling asleep to him being fine, looking at me like nothing had ever happened.  This diabetic coma was most likely caused by him not eating enough before his insulin shot that morning and the stress of traveling for Thanksgiving.</p>
		<p lang="en" style="text-align:center;padding-top:3px;">Cats should see a vet regularly for checkups, and there are several vaccines that must be given at a young age, some of which must be readministered throughout the cat's life.  Cats should be kept indoors, as it reduces disease and extends the life expectancy.  It is important to feed cats the right portion size, as cats can easily become overweight (part of the reason Tigger contracted diabetes).  Flea and tick medication is a must, as cats, even if they are completely indoor, can pick up bugs just by people tracking them in on their shoes.  Once fleas have infested a house, it is VERY difficult to exterminate them.  Some cats get along well with others, but it often take an adjustment period of a few weeks.  This might sound like a lot, but with cats, there is no need for a daily walk, picking up hot poop in little baggies, reluctant baths, house training, or keeping them in a crate all day.  If you are someone who wants an affectionate pet with a relatively small time committment to care for, a cat might be your best choice.<H3 style="color:purple;font-style:italic;">Tigger's Favorite Things to Do</H3>
